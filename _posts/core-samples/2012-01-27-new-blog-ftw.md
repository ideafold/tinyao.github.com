Thanks for stopping by my new experiment. This blog isn't powered by your traditional CMS. If you're from the Joomla, Drupal or Wordpress world this might just blow your mind.

## Built on Github Pages and Jekyll Bootstrap

### I think I've heard of Github Pages, refresh my memory though

Github pages are sites/pages hosted directly from your Github repo. Isn't that cool as hell? You can host a flat html page or make it dynamic with Jekyll. You just need to create a repo that matches your username like username.github.com and push to the master branch, and Github handles the rest! You can of course [point your domain to github](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).

### Right. What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

### Ok, then what is Jekyll Bootstrap?

It's exactly what it sounds like. A Bootstrap theme slapped on top of Jekyll.
